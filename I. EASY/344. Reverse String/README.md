Time complexity is $O(n / 2)$ where $n$ is the length of the input string. _(Main solution is the C++ solution)_

```
Write a function that reverses a string. The input string is given as an array of characters s.

You must do this by modifying the input array in-place with O(1) extra memory.



Example 1:

Input: s = ["h","e","l","l","o"]
Output: ["o","l","l","e","h"]


Example 2:

Input: s = ["H","a","n","n","a","h"]
Output: ["h","a","n","n","a","H"]


Constraints:

1 <= s.length <= 10^5
s[i] is a printable ascii character.
```
