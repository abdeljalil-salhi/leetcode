# 125. Valid Palindrome

Time complexity is $O(n)$ because I iterate through the string once. Best case scenario will be $O(n/2)$ due to the two-pointer approach.

```
A phrase is a palindrome if, after converting all uppercase letters into lowercase letters and removing all non-alphanumeric characters, it reads the same forward and backward. Alphanumeric characters include letters and numbers.

Given a string s, return true if it is a palindrome, or false otherwise.



Example 1:

Input: s = "A man, a plan, a canal: Panama"
Output: true
Explanation: "amanaplanacanalpanama" is a palindrome.


Example 2:

Input: s = "race a car"
Output: false
Explanation: "raceacar" is not a palindrome.


Example 3:

Input: s = " "
Output: true
Explanation: s is an empty string "" after removing non-alphanumeric characters.
Since an empty string reads the same forward and backward, it is a palindrome.


Constraints:

1 <= s.length <= 2 * 10^5
s consists only of printable ASCII characters.
```
